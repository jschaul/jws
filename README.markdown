A scala implementation of
[JSON Web Signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-31).

This was developed against the `draft-ietf-jose-json-web-signature-31` specification.
Currently only supports a small subset. The HMAC algorithms to be specific. Support for
the rest of the specification will come soon.
